You can clone this repository using git, then inference can be run when you have downloaded model weights and the necessary apptainer to run (see below).

To download model weights:
  * [click here for the best RNA-design weights](https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/2025_RFDpoly/train_session2024-07-08_1720455712_BFF_3.00.pt)
  * [click here for the best general multi-polymer weights](https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/2025_RFDpoly/train_session2024-06-27_1719522052_BFF_7.00.pt)

This software runs using apptainers. To download the associated apptainer `.sif` file, [click here](https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/2025_RFDpoly/SE3nv.sif)
Equivalent setup instructions for conda are in progress.

Once you have these files, you can follow the [design tutorial](https://github.com/andrewfavor95/polydiff/blob/main/RFDpoly_tutorial.pdf) to see various design tasks and the associated documentation/syntax.

Contact afavor@uw.edu if you have trouble accessing files or hit any bugs.





## Installation and setup

1. Set relevant paths for installation and navigate to directory for setup (change accordingly given your filesystem and choice of storage location):
```Bash
# Where you choose to install things (CHANGE THESE):
RFDPOLY_DIR=~/git/RFDpoly_paper_version
WEIGHTS_DIR=~/git/RFDpoly_paper_version/weights
ENV_DIR=~/git/RFDpoly_paper_version/exec

# Wherever you want to run some design jobs (ALSO CHANGE THIS):
DESIGN_DIR=~/git/RFDpoly_paper_version/design_jobs

# Make the directories
mkdir -p RFDPOLY_DIR
mkdir -p WEIGHTS_DIR
mkdir -p ENV_DIR
mkdir -p DESIGN_DIR

```

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to set up the repo, and clone it:
```Bash
cd $RFDPOLY_PATH
git clone git@github.com:andrewfavor95/polydiff.git

```

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to save model weights, download them, and set path variable for weights of your choice:
```Bash
# Download model weights:
cd $WEIGHTS_DIR

# Best weights for RNA-only design:
curl -O https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/2025_RFDpoly/train_session2024-06-27_1719522052_BFF_7.00.pt
# Best weights for generalized design across all polymer classes:
curl -O https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/2025_RFDpoly/train_session2024-07-08_1720455712_BFF_3.00.pt

# Set weights path (replace with your choice of weights):
MODEL_WEIGHTS_PATH=$WEIGHTS_DIR/train_session2024-07-08_1720455712_BFF_3.00.pt
export RFDPOLY_CKPT_PATH="$MODEL_WEIGHTS_PATH"

```

4. Navigate to the directory where you want to apptainer file, download it, and set path variable:
```Bash
cd $ENV_DIR
curl -O https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/2025_RFDpoly/SE3nv.sif
APPTAINER_PATH=$ENV_DIR/SE3nv.sif

```

## Testing that everything works:
Change directory to wherever you want to perform design, and run example inference script:
```Bash
cd $DESIGN_DIR

$APPTAINER_PATH $RFDPOLY_PATH/polydiff/rf_diffusion/run_inference.py --config-name=multi_polymer \
diffuser.T=50 \
inference.num_designs=3 \
contigmap.contigs=[\'33\ 33\ 75\'] \
contigmap.polymer_chains=[\'dna\',\'rna\',\'protein\'] \
inference.output_prefix=$RFDPOLY_PATH/test_outputs/basic_uncond_test01

```
The initial run will take a little while to precompute the IGSO3 cache, but subsequent runs will be more direct and quick.


If the example command above works, proceed to exploration of the full [design tutorial](https://github.com/andrewfavor95/polydiff/blob/main/RFDpoly_tutorial.pdf).

## Conda setup for macOS or Windows (no Apptainer)

The `rf_diffusion/environment/` directory captures the packages that ship with the Linux Apptainer image (`SE3nv.sif`). You can use these files as a template to build a local Conda environment on macOS or Windows:

1. Install a recent Anaconda, Miniconda, or Mambaforge build and ensure `conda` (or `mamba`) is on your `PATH`.
2. Review `rf_diffusion/environment/environment.yml` and remove Linux-only GPU packages (all `cuda-*`, `nvidia`, and `dglteam` channel entries) before creating the environment. macOS and Windows builds will fall back to CPU execution.
3. Create and activate the environment:
   ```bash
   mamba env create -f rf_diffusion/environment/environment.yml -n rfdpoly
   conda activate rfdpoly
   ```
   If the solver struggles, start with a base environment (e.g., `conda create -n rfdpoly python=3.10`) and install additional packages from `conda-explicit.txt` / `pip-freeze.txt`, skipping any platform-incompatible wheels.
4. (Optional) Apply the same Conda configuration used in the Apptainer by running:
   ```bash
   conda config --file rf_diffusion/environment/conda-config.txt
   ```
5. Verify the install with:
   ```bash
   python -m compileall rf_diffusion
   ```
6. Export the checkpoint path so the default configs can find your weights:
   ```bash
   export RFDPOLY_CKPT_PATH=/path/to/train_session2024-07-08_1720455712_BFF_3.00.pt
   ```

### Running inference from the Conda environment

Once the environment is active and model weights are downloaded:

```bash
conda activate rfdpoly                                   # or your chosen env name
python rf_diffusion/run_inference.py --config-name=multi_polymer \
  inference.ckpt_path=/path/to/train_session2024-07-08_1720455712_BFF_3.00.pt \
  diffuser.T=50 \
  inference.num_designs=3 \
  contigmap.contigs=['33 33 75'] \
  contigmap.polymer_chains=['dna','rna','protein'] \
  inference.output_prefix=./test_outputs/basic_uncond_test01
```

Notes:
* CPU execution is the default on macOS/Windows; GPU-specific flags (e.g., setting `torch` to CUDA) can be removed.
* Keep weight and output paths on a local filesystemâ€”UNC or network drives often slow down PyTorch file I/O on Windows.
* If you edit `multi_polymer.yaml`, place the customized copy under `rf_diffusion/config/inference/` and reference it with `--config-name=<new_name>`.
