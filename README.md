# Multi polymer diffusion

Clone this repository using git, then inference can be run when you have downloaded model weights and the necessary apptainer to run (see below).

Link to download model weights:
https://files.ipd.uw.edu/afavor/train_session2024-07-08_1720455712_BFF_3.00.pt

This software runs using apptainers. You can download the associated apptainer `.sif` file here:
https://files.ipd.uw.edu/afavor/SE3nv.sif

Once you have these files, you can follow the [design tutorial]([http://example.com](https://github.com/andrewfavor95/polydiff/blob/main/RFDpoly_tutorial.pdf)) to see various design tasks and the associated documentation/syntax.

Contact afavor@uw.edu if you have trouble accessing files or hit any bugs.
