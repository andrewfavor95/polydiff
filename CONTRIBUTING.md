## Documentation Contributions

To preview the changes you made to the documentation before making a Pull Request you will need to
install a few dependencies which can be done via
```
uv pip install -r docs/docs_requirements.txt
```

To build the documentation, navigate to `docs`  and run: 
```
make html
```
You will then be able to see the generated HTML pages in `build/html`
