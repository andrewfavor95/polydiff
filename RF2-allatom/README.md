RoseTTAFold All-Atom
--------------------

This repository contains the code to training and running inference on
RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA), a neural network that can predict the structures
of proteins in complex with DNA, RNA, and/or small molecule ligands.

`rf2aa/` contains the model and training code.
`data/` contains code used to curate the training data from the PDB.
